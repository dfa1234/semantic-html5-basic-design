    <h2>Why it matters</h2>

    <h3>Advantages of sticking to basic design</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Lightweight and loads fast</li>
      <li>Fits on all screens</li>
      <li>Looks the same in all browsers</li>
      <li>Accessible to every browser, even the older ones</li>
      <li>
        Legible and get one's point across (instead of diluting it with 5mb pics
        of hipsters drinking coffee :) )
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Now adding some basic CSS basic rules to improve readability at zero costs
      can help improve readability a lot:
    </p>

    <h3>CSS basic rules</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Because in the basic version lines are to close from each other and lack
        breathe: a minimum line-height 1.4 for body text, headings can be
        tighter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Like it's the case for a physical book, the text should not touch the
        browser borders.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is no true black on white in real life neither. Background #eee
        and foreground text #444 help to tone down.
      </li>
      <li>
        Body font size should render close to 16px, or more. Less is only good
        for printed pages, not on screen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Looking at screens require more efforts than on paper. Line should not
        never be longer than 200 characters long, and in average, 60 or 80
        characters is good enough.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Now, here some other meaningless text just to fill this page with some
      contents.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Semantic HTML</h2>

    <p>
      One of the most important features of HTML5 is its semantics. Semantic
      HTML refers to syntax that makes the HTML more comprehensible by better
      defining the different sections and layout of web pages. It makes web
      pages more
      <strong
        >informative and adaptable, allowing browsers and search engines to
        better interpret content </strong
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>Another last paragraph featuring Bob Ross</h2>

    <p>
      It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. No worries. No cares. Just float
      and wait for the wind to blow you around. This painting comes right out of
      your heart. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van
      Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. You've got to
      learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them
      happen.
